Iris Flower Classification (Multi-Class Classification)

Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica


The dataset used is the famous Iris Dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, which contains 150 samples with four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width


The task is a multi-class classification problem where the model predicts the species of a flower based on these measurements.

Steps in the Project

1. Data Loading – Import the iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.


2. Data Exploration – Understand the structure, classes, and distribution of features.


3. Data Preprocessing – Split the dataset into training and testing sets.


4. Model Training – Train a classifier (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) on the training data.


5. Model Evaluation – Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.


6. Model Saving (Optional) – Save the trained model with joblib for later use or deployment.

Technologies Used

Python 

scikit-learn

pandas, numpy

matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

joblib (for model saving)

Results

Achieved high accuracy (around 95–98%) on the test set.

Confusion matrix showed that the model correctly identified most flower classes.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow for a multi-class classification problem, from data preprocessing to deployment readiness.
