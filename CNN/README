ðŸ“Œ Description of Retinal Image Classification Code

This code builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for retinal image classification using the APTOS dataset (from train.csv and corresponding images).

ðŸ”¹ Steps in the Code

1. Load and Preprocess Data

Reads train.csv which contains image IDs and diagnosis labels.

Loads images from the train_images folder, resizes them to 224Ã—224 pixels, and normalizes pixel values to [0, 1].

Stores labels (diagnosis) for each image.

2. Train-Validation Split

Splits the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) using train_test_split.

3. CNN Model Architecture

Conv2D + MaxPooling layers: Extract spatial features.

Flatten: Converts 2D feature maps to 1D vectors.

Dense layer with 256 neurons: Learns deeper feature representations.

Dropout (0.5): Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons.

Output layer (softmax, 5 neurons): Classifies into 5 categories (diabetic retinopathy stages).

4. Model Compilation

Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate).

Loss: Sparse categorical cross-entropy (since labels are integers).

Metric: Accuracy.

5. Training

Trains the CNN for 15 epochs, with batch size 32.

Uses both training and validation data.

6. Evaluation

Evaluates on the validation set.

Reports Validation Accuracy.

Plots Training vs. Validation Accuracy and Loss curves.

7. Performance Metrics (Extended)

Calculates Precision, Recall, and F1-score using classification_report.

Displays a Confusion Matrix heatmap to show misclassifications.

8. Example Testing & Visualization

Picks a random image from validation set.

Shows the image along with its True label vs. Predicted label.
